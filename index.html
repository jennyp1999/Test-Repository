<!-- Version control - the process of managing and tracking changes to software code using version control software
  - Good for team work as members can upload new code or changes and the rest of the team can see it, ensures that
  the team is working with the same version -->

<!-- GitHub Definitions:
  Repository - All the folders and files associated with a project as well as each file's revision history
  Commit - a file version in the history of the file
  Branch - Line of development that allows for experimentation or the development of features or bug fixes
           without affecting the original branch.
         - Initialising a repository creates a branch that is called main by default
         - Branches can be merged
  Staging - prepares a file for the commit
          - changes that are staged will become part of the next snapshot of the project's history
          - useful as allows you to commit only what you are happy with, for example, if you are working
          on two features but have only finished one, staging only the finished feature allows you to commit only the finished featire -->

<!-- GitHub process - below are the commands needed to create and manage a repository:

  Initialise the current directory as a local git repository             :   git init -b main
    - Only needs to be done once per repository
    - Don't theink -b main is necessary as 
    the initialised branch is called main
    by default
  
  Add files in this directory to the local repository                    :   git add .
    - Î¤his stages the files for the commit

  Commit the files to the LOCAL repository with the label message name   :   git commit -m "message name"
    - This commits the files to the repository
    - Saves the staged 'snapshot' to the project
    history
  
  Transfers changes from a branch (branch-name) of the local repository  :   git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
  to the branch in the remote repository (remote-name)                                  

  Transfers changes from local repository to remote repository           :   git pull  

  COMMIT vs PUSH: Commit will only make changes to the local repository
                  Push will only make changes the remote repository
                
  Create a remote repository with the given name                         :   git remote add <name> <remote url>
    - url provides the location of the remote github repository
  
  Check the name and location of the remote repository                   :   git remote -v  -->


<!-- Local repository commands:
  - Create empty git repository : git init
  - Add new/modified files to staging area : git add .
  - Saves new/modified files to the local repository: git commit -m "commit message"
  - Display current status of the local repository : git status
    and tells us what the working branch is, if 
    the files are in the staging area, if there are
    no changes to commit
  - Tells us what branch the local repository is on : git branch
  - Creates a new branch : git branch <branch-name>
  - Lists all local and remote branches : git branch -a
  - Deletes a branch: git branch -d <branch-name>
  - Switches to an existing branch : git checkout <branch-name>
  - Creates a new branch and switches to it git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
  - Merges specified branches content into current branch : git merge <branch-name>
  -->

  <!-- Remote Repository Commands:
    - Creates a conntection to the remote repository  : git remote add <name> <remote-rep-url>
      AND associates a specified name to the remote repository url as shorthand
    - Creates a local working copy of a remote repository: git clone <remote-rep-url>
    - Fetches and merges changes in the remote repository to the local repository : git pull <branch-name> <remote-rep-url>
    - Transfers the local repository content to the remote repository : git push -u origin master
